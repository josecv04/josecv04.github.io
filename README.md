# Jose Resume Site (Recruiter-Optimized)

## Deploy
Repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main` / folder `/ (root)`.

## Replace placeholder visuals (recommended)
Put images in `assets/` and name them:
- `legoeeg.png`
- `microneedle.png`
- `robocar.png`
- `ecg-epg.png`

Once uploaded, swap each placeholder box with an <img> tag (or I can do it after you upload images).
